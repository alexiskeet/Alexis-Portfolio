# Alexis-Portfolio
## This website is my own personal portfolio for my work. There will be new additions to the website as I continue to work on new projects.

# Description 
## This website is a central location of some of the projects I have worked on. Currently there are many placeholders, but there will be many sections for my projects to be added and linked. 

# Usage
## This website serves as a place to showcase my work to instructors as well as future employers. This makes it easy to access my work and show off what I can do with HTML and CSS. 

# Finished Images of Application
## When the application is deployed, it will look like this:
